# District Energy Systems: Modelling paradigms and general-purpose tools
We present a comprehensive comparison of general purpose modelling tools for district scale energy systems.
All results including experimental data and simulation results are openly available here. 

* **DatabaseBlueprint.xlsx** blueprint of an online data base with detailed information about the various tools and their libraries (based on evaluations of the survey)
* **ExperimentalSetUp.pdf** a detailed description of the experimental set-up
* **SimulationInputs.xlsx*** input data for Case 1 and Case 2: Input temperature, mass flow, ambient temperature
* **SimulationResults.xlsx** simulation results of the case studies discussed in the paper
